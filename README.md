# Game Learning
Project to learn and play games using Deep Learning. 

# Sandwich 
Sandwich is a lib to build a Neural Network.  
(Much like 'lasagne', which I came to know about later)

# Status
- A CNN took about 35s to achieve an accuracy of 99.91 (slight overfitting) on a Nvidia GTX 650 GPU on the MNIST dataset.
- Training a CNN to predict Q values for ping-pong. (Deep game learning)   

# Finding your way around
