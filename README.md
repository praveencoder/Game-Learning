# Game-Learning
Project to learn and play games using Deep Learning. (a week old)

# Sandwich 
Sandwich is a lib to build a Neural Network. Much like 'lasange'.

# Current status
- Tested sandwich by training a LeNet to recognize handwritten digits.
- Added and tested various Gradient descent optimization techniques.

# Results
- Succesfully learns to recognize handwritten digits.

# Future work
- Use a NNet and policy learning to learn to play ping-pong. (Specifically ping-pong).
- Implement Google's deep game learning to play any Atari Game.
